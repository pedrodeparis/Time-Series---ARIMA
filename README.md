# üìà Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA and SARIMAX üï∞Ô∏è

Welcome to my Time Series Forecasting project using ARIMA and SARIMAX!

## Description

This project focuses on predicting future values in time series data through the implementation of ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors) models. The code includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps, providing insights into time series analysis.

## Key Features

- **ARIMA Modeling:** Utilizing AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average for time series forecasting.
- **SARIMAX Integration:** Incorporating Seasonal ARIMA with eXogenous factors for enhanced prediction accuracy.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling and cleaning time series data for optimal model performance.
